## Commons laws and regulations that must be followed when working with customers data:

### The Data Protection Act (DPA)

The Data Protection Act is a law that regulates the processing of personal data, ensuring that individuals' information is handled fairly, lawfully, and securely. It protects people and lays down rules about how data about people can be used by organisations, businesses or the government.

### The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in and outside of the European Union (EU). Although the UK has left the EU, the GDPR has been incorporated into UK law as the UK GDPR.

### The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that allows individuals to access information held by public authorities, such as government departments, local councils, and other public bodies. The FOIA aims to promote transparency, accountability, and openness in government.

### The Computer Misuse Act (CMA)

The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) is a law in the United Kingdom that makes it a criminal offense to access or modify computer systems or data without authorisation. The CMA aims to prevent and punish unauthorized access, use, or interference with computer systems, networks, and data.

The computer misuse act 1990 is an act where an individual can be criminalised because of computer related offense. Three extra powers that the Police and Justice Act 2006 (Computer Misuse) has added.

**Unlawful Possession of Articles for Use in Computer Misuse Offenses:**
The Act introduced an offense for the possession of articles (such as hacking tools or malware) with the intent to use them for committing computer misuse offenses. This provision enables law enforcement to take action against individuals even before an actual crime is committed, targeting the tools that could facilitate computer crimes.

**Amendment to Sentences for Computer Misuse Offenses:**
The Act increased the severity of penalties for certain computer-related offenses. For example, it introduced harsher sentencing for those convicted of committing unauthorised access or damage with the intent to cause serious harm. This includes a potential life sentence in the most severe cases.

**Offense of Unauthorised Access with Intent to Commit or Facilitate Further Offenses:**

A new offense was created under the Act that targets individuals who access computer systems without authorisation, intending to commit or facilitate another criminal act (such as fraud or terrorism). This power extends the scope of the Computer Misuse Act, making it easier to prosecute individuals whose actions might aid or prepare other criminal activities.

**Example of: Copyright infringement**

A person downloads and distributes a pirated version of a movie without permission from the copyright holder. This act violates the copyright laws of the original creators, as they have exclusive rights to distribute, reproduce, and sell copies of their work. By sharing the unauthorised copy, the individual is infringing upon the copyright owner's rights.

**Example of: Plagiarism**

A student submits a research paper for a class, copying large sections of text directly from an online article without giving proper credit to the original author. The student presents the work as their own, failing to cite the source of the copied material. This is plagiarism because the student is using someone else's ideas or words without acknowledgment, violating academic integrity rules.

**Two consequences of copyright infringement and software piracy**

**Legal Penalties:** Individuals or businesses found guilty of copyright infringement or software piracy may face significant legal consequences, including fines and lawsuits. In some cases, copyright holders can seek damages through civil lawsuits, and criminal cases could result in imprisonment. For example, software piracy could lead to hefty fines and jail time, depending on the scale of the infringement.

**Financial Losses and Damaged Reputation:** Copyright infringement and software piracy can result in financial losses for creators or companies due to lost sales or royalties. Additionally, businesses or individuals caught engaging in piracy may suffer from a damaged reputation, which can undermine consumer trust, harm brand image, and lead to loss of future opportunities or partnerships. This can be especially damaging in industries reliant on intellectual property, like media, technology, and entertainment.

**Three possible consequences for individuals when using pirated software**

**Legal Consequences:** Using pirated software is illegal and can result in fines or even criminal charges. Individuals caught using or distributing pirated software can be held liable for copyright infringement, potentially facing costly legal action.

**Security Risks:** Pirated software often comes with malware or viruses that can compromise the security of a user's device. These malicious programs may steal personal data, corrupt files, or damage the system, leading to potential data breaches or identity theft.

**Lack of Support and Updates:** Pirated software does not receive official updates or technical support from the software developer. This means that the software may become outdated, vulnerable to security issues, and lack essential features or fixes, ultimately affecting its performance and functionality.
